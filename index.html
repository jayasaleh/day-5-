            <p>Learning to code can be like preparing for a long battle. Ultimately, winning is not always determined by your initial strength, but by how well prepared you are and how long you can hold out.
                With programming, the greatest challenge is often not the complexity of the language, but rather staying consistent and motivated through the learning process.
                In order to stay consistent with your learning, you will need a lot of motivation and energy. The consistency with which you learn would help you to understand the complex concepts of any programming language and make the most of your time.
                Having come from an absolutely non-technical background, I had to learn this late. After I took the first step into the transition, I struggled with everything relating to learning, particularly motivation.
